## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
The purpose of this project is twofold. First, I wanted to learn to better communicate my findings through visuals. Second, I was interested in using the Global Terrorism Database (1970 - 2018) to better understand:
1. Has the number of attacks increased over the years?
2. Which are the most affected continents, countries, cities?
3. Relationship between happiness score and terrorism?
