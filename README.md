## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The only external libraries necessary to run this code, beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python, are Plotly and Cartopy.
</br>Instructions on how to install Plotly can be found [here](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/).
</br>Instructions on how to install Cartopy can be found [here](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.16/installing.html#installing).

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
The purpose of this project is twofold. First, I wanted to learn to better communicate my findings through visuals. Second, I was interested in using the Global Terrorism Database (1970 - 2017) to better understand:
1. Has the number of attacks increased over the years?
2. Which regions are most affected with regards to:
    1. Number of attacks
    2. Casualties
    3. Successful/failed attacks
3. Which type of attack is most common as well as most effective with regards to the number of casualties?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The following are the files available in this repository:
* `global-terrorism-analysis.ipynb` - a notebook of the analysis performed following the CRISP-DM process.
* `globalterrorism_0718dist.csv` - csv file that contains the data.
* `/BG/BM.jpg` and `/BG/BM_high.png` - background images used for plots.
* `attacks.mp4` - video generated that shows attacks on a global map.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

</br>A big shoutout to Mat Leonard for writing this [blog post](https://medium.com/udacity/creating-map-animations-with-python-97e24040f17b). This post made it possible for me to create the video showing attacks around the world.
